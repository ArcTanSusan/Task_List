Task_List
=========

Final version of the Task List Flask webapp that I made in 4th week of Hackbright Academy. 
You can add or remove tasks. And add or remove usernames/emails. Tools used: flask, html, sqlite3, sqlalchemy.

Go to url "/tasks" to see list of all tasks.

For fun, I also incorporated the Markov text generator, which was also made during Hackbright Academy, 
in the url "/tasks/Susan". The text will generate orignal text from novel The Picture 
of Dorian Gray.
